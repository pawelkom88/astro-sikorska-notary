    <h1 class="heading">Comprehensive Notary Services for Individuals</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Each notarial matter is different, and every client is treated individually. However, there
      are some typical stages of notarial activities and lists of required documents similar for
      most clients. It is essential that great care is taken at every stage to minimise the risks of
      errors, omissions, alterations, fraud, forgery or money laundering.

    <ol>
      <h2 class="underline">Initial Contact</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph no-list-style">
        To avoid any delays and mistakes, make sure that you can produce the following as soon as
        you make initial contact with the notary:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol class="list-style-letters">
        <li>
          ELECTRONIC COPY OF YOUR IDENTIFICATION DOCUMENTS (Proof of Identity and Proof of
          Residence)
        </li>
        <li>
          EVIDENCE OF AUTHORITY TO SIGN IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY (PoA, EPA, LPA, Court Order or
          a Trustee in Bankruptcy)
        </li>
        <li style="list-style: upper-alpha">
          DOCUMENTS RELEVANT FOR THE MATTER (including the document to be notarised and any forms of
          instructions given by the overseas lawyer or legal advisor who prepared the document).
        </li>
        <li class="no-list-style">
          Make sure that you do not sign the document in advance of your appointment with the
          Notary!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <li class="underline">
        REVIEW OF THE INSTRUCTIONS & ASSESSMENT OF YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACT
      </li>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        After reviewing the instructions and documents, the notary will advise you on the
        formalities required for completing the notarial certificates. However, they will not be
        able to advise you on the overall nature of the transactions that are to take effect in the
        receiving jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        If the notary is in doubt of you understanding the effect of the act, they may suggest
        obtaining<strong> independent legal</strong>advice before completing the notarial act for
        you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        If the document is in a foreign language which you do not understand su­fficiently, the
        notary may have to insist that a <strong>translation</strong> be obtained. If you arrange
        for a professional translation, the translator should add his/her name, address, relevant
        qualification, and a certificate stating:
        <i
          >“Document X is a true and complete translation of document Y, to which this translation
          is attached.”</i
        >
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        If you and the Notary cannot understand each other because of a language diffi­culty, we may
        have to make arrangements for a competent <strong>interpreter</strong> to be available at
        our interview and this may involve a further fee.
      </p>
      <br />
      <li class="underline">
        CONTACTING OVERSEAS LAWYER / LEGAL ADVISORS/ FOREIGN AUTHORITY REGARDING THE INSTRUCTIONS
      </li>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        When there are any overseas lawyers or legal advisors involved in the matter, you should
        provide the notary with their contact details and any covering correspondence received from
        them to enable efficient communication regarding the instructions. The Notary may need to
        liaise with lawyers abroad to agree any amendments needed to ensure the document satisfies
        all legal requirements both here and abroad. This may take some time and may require more
        than one meeting to finalise.
      </p>
      <br />
      <li class="underline">ARRANGING A MEETING WITH THE NOTARY</li>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        Once the notary is satisfied with the presented documents and information, a meeting will be
        arranged. Usually, it takes no longer than half an hour if the document is straightforward
        and in the correct form. During the appointment the notary will verify your identity and
        ascertain that you understand what you are signing and that you are doing so of your own
        free will.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        The notary will then ensure that the document is correctly executed and draft and affix (or
        endorse) a notarial certificate to the document.
      </p>
      <br />
      <li class="underline">ARRANGING FOR THE LEGISLATION OF THE DOCUMENT (IF APPLICABLE)</li>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        Sometimes it is not sufficient to notarise the document, but it also needs to be legalised
        by the FCDO or the Consulate of the country that the documents are for. Legalisation is the
        official confirmation that a signature, seal or stamp on a document is genuine. If the
        legislation is required by the receiving jurisdiction, the notary will advise you on the
        exact procedure and your available options to obtain it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 class="underline">Storage of Copies of the Notarial Act</h2>
      <br />
      <p class="paragraph">
        The notary is required to store your records in accordance with the Notarial Practice Rules
        2019.
